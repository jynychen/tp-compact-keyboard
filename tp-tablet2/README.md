Thinkpad Tablet 2 Keyboard
==========================

* [User guide](https://download.lenovo.com/ibmdl/pub/pc/pccbbs/mobiles_pdf/tablet2_bluetooth_keyboard_ug_en_0b40450.pdf)

Older than the compact keyboards the above, it was sold with the Tablet 2 and has a fold-out stand
for said tablet.

It doesn't have a trackpoint, rather a Blackberry-esque tiny trackpad which you
use like a trackball.

Pairing
-------

Pairing is a bit temperamental, it helps to reset the keyboard.

* Enter pair mode: ``Fn``+``Delete``
* Full reset: Turn off keyboard, pull power switch pressing ``Esc``+``Delete`` until status LED blinks Amber.

Dissassembly
------------

* Unclip the frame around the keyboard, the power slider just pokes the real button underneath.
* Undo the 4 screws holding the keyboard down (including the tri-wing screw with ground connection)
* Gently pry the keyboard from the metal backing plate it's glued to
  * The keyboard ribbon cable loops around underneath the trackpoint buttons, don't pry there
  * The trackpoint ribbon is underneath the trackpoint
  * Do **not** pry the backing plate away from the bottom plastic, whilst some screws are visible and it looks like it will come off that way, there are more screws underneath the keyboard.q
* Undo all the metal backing plate screws.

Drivers
-------

Drivers are listed [as part of the Thinkpad Tablet 2 page](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/gb/en/products/tablets/thinkpad-tablet-series/thinkpad-tablet-2/downloads/driver-list), "ThinkPad Optical TrackPoint Driver for Windows 8.1 (32-bit), 8 (32-bit) - ThinkPad Tablet 2" & "Hotkey Features Integration for Windows 8.1 (32-bit, 64-bit) - ThinkPad". However, neither seem to do anything in a Windows 8 VM.
